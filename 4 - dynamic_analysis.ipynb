    "# Part 4: Dynamic Network Analysis & Enhanced Feature Engineering for Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook continues from Part 2, utilizing the `trade_data_features.csv` file. The primary goal is to enrich our dataset with features derived from the dynamic, year-over-year evolution of the global trade network. These features are crucial for building more accurate and insightful predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives are:\n",
    "1.  **Iteratively Construct Yearly Trade Networks**: For each year from 1988 to 2024, build a directed, weighted graph representing trade flows.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Dynamic Centrality Measures**: Compute various centrality metrics (PageRank, HITS, Harmonic, Betweenness) for each country within each yearly network, generating a total of 2,967 country-year centrality records.\n",
    "3.  **Engineer Rolling Statistics for Centralities**: To capture trends and volatility, calculate 3-year rolling means and standard deviations of these centrality scores.\n",
    "4.  **Perform Dynamic Community Detection**: Employ the Louvain algorithm on yearly networks to identify evolving trade communities, resulting in 2,967 country-year community assignments.\n",
    "5.  **Engineer Features from Dynamic Communities**: Derive features such as `community_stability` to quantify how often a country changes its community membership.\n",
    "6.  **Integrate Dynamic Features**: Merge all 34 newly created dynamic features (for both importer and exporter perspectives) back into the main dataset, expanding it to 825 columns.\n",
    "7.  **Lag Features for Forecasting**: Lag all 34 dynamic features by one year to prevent data leakage in predictive models.\n",
    "8.  **Handle Missing Values**: Address `NaN` values introduced by rolling, lagging, or incomplete data using median imputation.\n",
    "9.  **Save Enriched Data**: Output the final, feature-engineered DataFrame with 859 columns, ready for predictive modeling in Part 5."

    "Using the yearly community assignments, we create features that describe a country's community behavior over time. A key feature is **community stability**, which is calculated as `1 - rolling_mean(community_changed)` over a 3-year window. A value closer to 1 indicates a country has high stability (rarely changes trade blocs), while a value closer to 0 indicates frequent community shifts. This feature helps quantify the consistency of a country's trade alliances."

This ensures that to predict a value for year `Y`, we only use information available up to year `Y-1`, preventing data leakage. All **34** dynamic network features (e.g., `importer_pagerank_dyn`, `exporter_community_stability_dyn`) are shifted by one year for each `trade_pair_id`, creating a new set of `_lag1` features. The original, non-lagged versions are kept for potential analytical use, but only the lagged versions will be used for modeling."

    "This notebook has successfully executed a comprehensive dynamic network analysis. We have:\n",
    "- Constructed yearly trade networks and calculated dynamic centrality measures (PageRank, HITS, etc.) for each country.\n",
    "- Engineered rolling statistics for these centralities to capture trends and stability.\n",
    "- Performed dynamic community detection using the Louvain algorithm and derived features like community stability.\n",
    "- Merged these rich, dynamic, network-based features back into our main dataset for both importer and exporter roles.\n",
    "- Lagged all newly created dynamic features by one year to ensure their suitability for forecasting.\n",
    "- Addressed all new missing values using median imputation.\n",

    "The resulting DataFrame, saved as `trade_data_dynamic_features.csv`, is now substantially enhanced with features that reflect the evolving structure and interconnectedness of the global trade system. This dataset forms a strong foundation for Part 5, where we will focus on building and evaluating predictive models."
